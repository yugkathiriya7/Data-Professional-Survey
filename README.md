# Data-Professional-Survey Dashboard
🚀 Exploring Data in Power BI! 🎨📊

I recently worked on visualizing data from the Data Professional Survey in Power BI, inspired by [Alex the Analyst (https://youtu.be/I0vQ_VLZTWg?si=UMkLNiMYNbSf1tU4) ] but with my own twist! Here's what I did differently:

✅ Structured the visualization uniquely – rearranged insights for better clarity.
🎨 Added different colors to enhance readability and aesthetics.
🧹 Data Cleaning in Power BI – learned how to:
🔹 Split columns by delimiter
🔹 Create new calculated columns (like Average Salary from range values)

🔎 Key Insights:
💰 Data Scientists seem to have the highest average salary among job titles.
🌎 Most respondents were from the United States, followed by India.
🐍 Python dominates as the most preferred programming language.
⚖️ Work-life balance & salary satisfaction vary significantly across job roles.
